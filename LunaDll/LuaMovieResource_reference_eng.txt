LuaMovieResource can be treated as LuaImageResource

Mapping:Channel num -> Channel
	0->B
	1->G
	2->R
	3->A
	4->Additional B
	5->Additional G
	6->Additional R
	7->Additional A

SMBX Graphics can be overriden in the same way of replacing with gif.(need lunaall.lua)
(e.g. npc-1.mp4 replaces the graphics of the npc ID:1)

・Graphics.loadMovie(string filepath)
	Load a movie file and return an instance of LuaMovieResource.
	The file with suffix "_m" is also loaded as additional channels if the file exists.
	(e.g. filepath=smbx.mp4 -> additional channel file = smbx_m.mp4)

・Graphics.draw****
	Draw(refresh) one frame of the movie.
	When the movie is rendered, the audio is also played.
	The rendered frame is synchronized with audio. 

・Graphics.drawImageScaleWP(LuaMovieResource img,number screenX,number screenY,number width,number height,number priority)
・Graphics.drawImageScaleWP(LuaMovieResource img,number screenX,number screenY,number width,number height,number opacity,number priority)
	Additional draw function with scaling.
	Draw a frame with the size width x height at (screenX,screenY)

・Graphics.sprites.####[*].img = LuaMovieResource movie
	This is same as LuaImageResource.
    
・Graphics.movieHitEvent(LuaMovieResource img,function callback(number))
	Set a callback function that is called when the player touched the hit area.
	The argument is channel number.

・movie:play()
	Play the movie.

・movie:pause()
	Pause the movie.

・movie:stop()
	Stop the movie.(Back to start)

・movie:seek(number seconds)
	Seek the movie to the specified time (in second)

・movie:setMaskThreshold(number ch,number threshold)
	Set the hit area threshold of the specified channel.
	Pixels larger than this value are treated as hit area.
	Default:256 (>255 no hit area)
    
・movie.videoDelay = number delay
	Set the delay of the video.
	Default:0
    
・movie.maskDelay = number delay
	Set the delay of the additional video.
	Default:0
	
    
・movie.scaleUpMode = number mode
	Set the algorithm used when scale up
	0=Nearest neighbor,1=Bilinear,other=Nearest neightbor
    	Default:0

・movie.scaleDownMode = number mode
	Set the algorithm used when scale down
	0=Nearest neighbor,1=Bilinear,other=Nearest neightbor
    	Default:0

・movie.offScreenMode = number mode
	Set the behavior when the movie went out of the screen.
	0=do nothing,1=pause,2=stop,other=do nothing
    	Default:1
	
・movie.onScreenMode = number mode
	Set the behavior when the movie came into the screen.
	0=do nothing,1=play
   	Default:1
	
・movie.loop = bool enable
	Set whether movie loops or not/
	Default:true

・movie.altAlpha = number channel
	Set the alternative alpha channel. -1=Unused
    	Default:-1
    
・movie.alphaType = number mode
	Set how to treat alpha channel.
	0=premultiplied,1=straight
	Default:0

・movie.volume = number volume
	Set the volume of audio.
	Default:100
